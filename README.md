# Sorting and Pathfinding Visualizer

## Overview

This Java and JavaFX project aims to provide a visually intuitive representation of various sorting and pathfinding algorithms. The application allows users to interactively explore and understand the inner workings of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort, as well as pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The visualizations help users grasp the algorithms' behavior and compare their efficiency in real-world scenarios.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms:

1. **Bubble Sort:**
   - Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
   - Visualizes the process of iteratively swapping adjacent elements until the entire list is sorted.

2. **Insertion Sort:**
   - Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
   - Demonstrates the process of selecting an element and inserting it into its correct position.

3. **Heap Sort:**
   - Utilizes a binary heap data structure.
   - Illustrates the creation of a max heap and the successive extraction of the maximum element.

4. **Quick Sort:**
   - Employs a divide-and-conquer strategy.
   - Shows how the array is partitioned and sorted recursively.

### Pathfinding Algorithms:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
   - Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
   - Visualizes the exploration of nodes and the relaxation of edges.

2. **A* Algorithm:**
   - Combines elements of Dijkstra's Algorithm and heuristic approaches.
   - Demonstrates the search for the optimal path by considering both the cost and heuristic values.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Explores all the vertices at the current depth prior to moving on to vertices at the next depth level.
   - Visualizes the breadth-first exploration of the graph.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Open the Project in Your Preferred IDE:**
   - Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the `Main` class to launch the sorting and pathfinding visualizer.

4. **Explore Algorithms:**
   - Select a sorting or pathfinding algorithm from the menu.
   - Adjust parameters or provide input data as needed.
   - Click the "Visualize" button to observe the algorithm in action.

## Dependencies

- JavaFX library for building the graphical user interface.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later.
